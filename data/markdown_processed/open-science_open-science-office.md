# Open Science Office

The Open Science Office supports researchers at all career stages and from all disciplines in implementing Open Science practices. It is interconnected with the [Open Access team](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/open-science/open-science-office/), the [Research Data Center](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/en/teaching-and-research/research-data-center-fdz/), the [Research Support Unit](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/universitaet/organisation/verwaltung/dezernat-i/), and other players.

## Training and Educating Researchers

At the Open Science Office, we provide and organize Open Science seminars as part of the [Research Skills Seminar](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/en/teaching-and-research/research-skills/) series at UB Mannheim every semester. The Open Science Office typically offers training opportunities on the following topics, but we are always open to your ideas:

* Open Access, Open Data, and Open Research Practices
* Preregistrations and Registered Reports
* Technical Workflows for Reproducibility (e.g., R Markdown and Docker)
* Citizen Science

## Research Support and Services

Do you have questions about how to deal with Open Science practices in your research project or next publication? You can contact the Open Science Office for one-on-one consultations. We are happy to answer questions related to:

* Implementing individual Open Science Practices
* What to write and plan for in terms of Open Science for your next funding proposal to the DFG, BW-Stiftung, or EU
* Integrating Open Science Practices into your research workflow with your collaborators
* Finding suitable research infrastructures to support you with Open Science Practices

## Open Science Grants

The University of Mannheim is committed to transparent and inclusive research practices, open access to scientific results, and reproducibility of research. In this context, university-wide [Open Science Grants](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/open-science/grants/) are offered. In annual funding rounds, applications for small research projects and events related to Open Science are funded. The Open Science Office organizes the calls, the review process, and the distribution of funds, as well as accompanying the project during its entire duration.

## Networking and Outreach

The Open Science Office provides organizational and financial support to a grassroots initiative, the [Mannheim Open Science Meetup](https://osf.io/gzf9h/), which provides a space to discuss current Open Science topics. If you are interested in joining, sign up for the [mailing list](https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/info/mannheim-open-science). The Open Science Office also works nationally and internationally for the University of Mannheim, which is an institutional member of the [German Reproducibility Network](https://reproducibilitynetwork.de) and one of the [Global Reproducibility Networks](https://www.ukrn.org/global-networks/), to promote an institutionalized approach to Open Science.
