# Open Science Office

The Open Science Office at the University of Mannheim supports researchers at all career stages and from all disciplines in implementing Open Science practices. It collaborates closely with the Open Access team, the [Research Data Center](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/en/teaching-and-research/research-data-center-fdz/), the [Research Support Unit](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/universitaet/organisation/verwaltung/dezernat-i/), and other stakeholders.

## Training and Educating Researchers

The Open Science Office organizes and provides Open Science seminars as part of the [Research Skills Seminar](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/en/teaching-and-research/research-skills/) series at UB Mannheim every semester. Typical training topics include:

- Open Access, Open Data, and Open Research Practices
- Preregistrations and Registered Reports
- Technical Workflows for Reproducibility (e.g., R Markdown and Docker)
- Citizen Science

Suggestions for additional topics are welcome.

## Research Support and Services

Researchers can contact the Open Science Office for one-on-one consultations regarding Open Science practices in research projects or publications. Support is offered for:

- Implementing individual Open Science practices
- Planning and writing Open Science sections for funding proposals (e.g., DFG, BW-Stiftung, EU)
- Integrating Open Science practices into research workflows with collaborators
- Identifying suitable research infrastructures for Open Science

## Open Science Grants

The University of Mannheim promotes transparent and inclusive research practices, open access to scientific results, and reproducibility. [University-wide Open Science Grants](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/open-science/grants/) are offered in annual funding rounds for small research projects and events related to Open Science. The Open Science Office manages the calls, review process, fund distribution, and project support.
