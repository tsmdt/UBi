# Open Science
Open Science encompasses classical aspects such as Open Access, open data, and software, as well as societal concepts like Third Mission, Citizen Science, and Open Innovation. The driving factors are transparent and inclusive research practices, open access to scientific findings, and the reproducibility of research results.

The University of Mannheim is committed to transparent and replicable research, encouraging these goals through open science practices, including pre-registration, open data, open materials, and open source. The university joined the [German Reproducibility Network (GRN)](https://reproducibilitynetwork.de/) in July 2022. Since autumn 2022, the university's recruitment guidelines have included a request for a planned contribution to Open Science in the application documents for professorships. Additionally, an [Open Science Office](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/open-science/open-science-office/) has been established to support researchers at all career stages and from all disciplines.

## Open Science Office
The Open Science Office fosters and supports Open Science approaches of researchers across all academic disciplines at the University of Mannheim.
